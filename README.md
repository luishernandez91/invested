### Built With

I chose the following libraries/frameworks to build both frontend and backed

* [Angular](https://angular.io/)
* [Ngxs](https://www.ngxs.io/)
* [Angular material](https://material.angular.io/)
* [Mongo Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/lp/try-atlas)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This project contains both frontend and backend development using nodejs with express for REST api services and Angular v15 for frontend side. Therefore, it is necessary to run the project with the following commands inside root project directory


  ```sh
  npm run mock:server
  ng serve
  ```
Login credentials:
* email: luis@mail.com
* pass: 1234

When the application is executed, it will connect to Mongo atlas with access to a remote database
